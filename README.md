## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
EDA is a crucial initial step in data analysis that involves exploring and summarizing key characteristics, patterns, and relationships present in the dataset. Here are some common tasks performed during EDA:

1. <b> Data Collection </b>: Gathering the dataset from various sources, such as databases, files, or APIs.
2. <b>Data Cleaning </b>: Preprocessing the data to handle missing values, outliers, duplicates, and other inconsistencies. This may involve imputation, removal, or transformation of data.
    - 1. <b>Outlier Detection</b>: Identifying and handling outliers that may skew the analysis or modeling results.
    - 2. <b>Missing Value Imputation</b>: Handling missing values by imputing them using techniques such as mean, median, mode, or advanced imputation methods like KNN imputation or predictive modeling.
3. <b>Descriptive Statistics</b>: Computing summary statistics (e.g., mean, median, mode, standard deviation, range) to understand the basic properties of the data.
4. <b>Univariate Analysis</b>: Analyzing individual variables to understand their distributions, identify outliers, and detect patterns. This may involve histograms, box plots, or kernel density plots.
5. <b>Bivariate Analysis</b>: Exploring relationships between pairs of variables to identify correlations, dependencies, or associations. Techniques include scatter plots, heatmaps, and correlation matrices.
6. <b>Multivariate Analysis</b>: Investigating relationships involving multiple variables simultaneously. This may include techniques like principal component analysis (PCA) or clustering.
7. <b>Data Visualization</b>: Creating visual representations (e.g., plots, charts, graphs) to summarize and communicate insights from the data effectively.
8. <b>Feature Engineering</b>: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance. This may involve encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, or creating interaction terms.
9. <b>Statistical Testing</b>: Conducting hypothesis tests to validate assumptions, compare groups, or assess relationships between variables.
10. <b>Time-Series Analysis</b>: If dealing with time-series data, analyzing trends, seasonality, and forecasting future values.
