1. ## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
EDA is a crucial initial step in data analysis that involves exploring and summarizing key characteristics, patterns, and relationships present in the dataset. Here are some common tasks performed during EDA:

1. Data Collection: Gathering the dataset from various sources, such as databases, files, or APIs.
2. Data Cleaning: Preprocessing the data to handle missing values, outliers, duplicates, and other inconsistencies. This may involve imputation, removal, or transformation of data.
3. Descriptive Statistics: Computing summary statistics (e.g., mean, median, mode, standard deviation, range) to understand the basic properties of the data.
4. Univariate Analysis: Analyzing individual variables to understand their distributions, identify outliers, and detect patterns. This may involve histograms, box plots, or kernel density plots.
5. Bivariate Analysis: Exploring relationships between pairs of variables to identify correlations, dependencies, or associations. Techniques include scatter plots, heatmaps, and correlation matrices.
6. Multivariate Analysis: Investigating relationships involving multiple variables simultaneously. This may include techniques like principal component analysis (PCA) or clustering.
7. Data Visualization: Creating visual representations (e.g., plots, charts, graphs) to summarize and communicate insights from the data effectively.
8. Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance. This may involve encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, or creating interaction terms.
9. Outlier Detection: Identifying and handling outliers that may skew the analysis or modeling results.
10. Missing Value Imputation: Handling missing values by imputing them using techniques such as mean, median, mode, or advanced imputation methods like KNN imputation or predictive modeling.
11. Data Transformation: Applying transformations such as normalization or standardization to make the data suitable for modeling.
12. Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the number of features by techniques like PCA or feature selection methods to improve model efficiency and interpretability.
13. Statistical Testing: Conducting hypothesis tests to validate assumptions, compare groups, or assess relationships between variables.
14. Time-Series Analysis: If dealing with time-series data, analyzing trends, seasonality, and forecasting future values.
15. Text Analysis: If dealing with text data, performing tasks such as tokenization, stemming, or sentiment analysis.
16. Model Building Preparation: Preparing the data for model building by splitting it into training and testing sets, and possibly performing additional preprocessing steps specific to the chosen modeling approach.
